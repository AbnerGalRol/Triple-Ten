# Project Description

You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games worldwide. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow you to detect promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.

You have data dating back to 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016, and you're planning a campaign for 2017.

The key is to gain experience working with data. It doesn't really matter if you're forecasting 2017 sales based on 2016 data or 2027 sales based on 2026 data.

The dataset contains a "rating" column that stores the ESRB rating of each game. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates the content of a game and assigns an age rating such as Teen or Adult.

## Hypotesis


- The average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.

- The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
