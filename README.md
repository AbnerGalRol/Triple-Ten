# Triple-Ten Bootcamp Projects

Welcome to my repository containing projects completed during a Data Science Bootcamp. Throughout the triple-ten bootcamp, I completed 16 projects covering a wide range of topics, starting from basic Python programming to building advanced machine learning models. In addition to programming skills, I also gained proficiency in various aspects of data science, including data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, data storage, and data compilation.
