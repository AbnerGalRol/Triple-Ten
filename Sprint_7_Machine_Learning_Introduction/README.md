**Problem Statement**

The mobile company Megaline is not satisfied to see that many of its customers are using legacy plans. They want to develop a model that can analyze customer behavior and recommend one of Megaline's new plans: Smart or Ultra.

To do this, we will create a classification model. We will create different models to choose the one with the best accuracy. Our goal will be to achieve an accuracy equal to or greater than 0.75.

We will create a decision tree model, a random forest model, and logistic regression.
