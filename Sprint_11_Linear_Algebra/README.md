# Sure Tomorrow

Sure Tomorrow insurance company wants to address several tasks using machine learning and asks you to evaluate this possibility.

- Task 1: Find clients who are similar to a specific client. This will help the company's agents with marketing.
- Task 2: Predict whether a new client is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Can a prediction model outperform a fictitious model?
- Task 3: Predict the amount of insurance benefits a new client is likely to receive using a linear regression model.
- Task 4: Protect clients' personal data without breaking the model from the previous task.

It is necessary to develop a data transformation algorithm that makes it difficult to recover personal information if the data falls into the wrong hands. This is called data masking or data obfuscation. However, the data must be protected in such a way that the quality of the machine learning models is not affected. It is not necessary to choose the best model; it is sufficient to demonstrate that the algorithm works correctly.
