# Analysis of Default Risk of Borrowers

Your project involves preparing a report for the loan division of a bank. You will need to find out if the marital status and number of children of a client have an impact on loan repayment default. The bank already has some data on the creditworthiness of clients.

Your report will be taken into account when creating a credit score for a potential client. The credit score is used to assess the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

## Hypotheses

- Marital status influences a client's repayment compliance.
- The number of children influences a client's repayment compliance.
- Income level influences a client's repayment compliance.
- The purpose of the loan influences a client's repayment compliance.
