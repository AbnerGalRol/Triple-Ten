# Film Junky Union

Film Junky Union, a new cutting-edge community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system to filter and categorize movie reviews. Your goal is to train a model to automatically detect negative reviews. To achieve this, you will use a dataset of movie reviews from IMDB with labeling to build a model that classifies reviews as positive and negative. It should achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85.
