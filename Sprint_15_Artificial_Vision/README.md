# Good Seed

The supermarket chain Good Seed would like to explore if data science can help them comply with alcohol laws by ensuring that they do not sell alcohol to underage individuals. They ask you to perform this evaluation, so when you start working, consider the following:

The stores are equipped with cameras in the checkout area, which are activated when a person is purchasing alcohol.
Computer vision methods can be used to determine a person's age from a photo.
The task, then, is to build and evaluate a model to verify people's age.
To begin working on the task, you will have a dataset of photographs of individuals indicating their age.
